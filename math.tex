    for the entire part of Computer Science, Chapter 3, the variable naming standard will be as follows:
    \begin{center}
        i is input\\ o is output
    \end{center}
    unlesss stated otherwise.

        \subsubsection{bases}
        given  \begin{center}
            $n$ = base of number representation\\
            $x$ = number that is represented in base $n$,
        \end{center}
        Then $\dfrac{x}{n}$ shiftes everything in $x$ towards the left by one and $x\cdot n$ shiftes everything to the right.
        \subsubsection{logrithmic base 2}
        when taking $\log_2(1+x)$ where $0<x \leq1$, the output is approx. $x$.\\

        \\but by adding $\mu$ to this, we can lower the amount of error to the average.
        to find $\mu$, we can do a mean value theorem stated in calculus portion to find $\mu$, which can be gotten from
        \begin{center}
            if$f(x)=\log_2(x+1)$, then $$f'(x)=\dfrac{1}{(x+1)\ln(2)}$$since the average rate of change is $$\dfrac{f(1)-f(0)}{1-0}=1$$
            then to get $\mu$, the steps are $$f'(c)=\dfrac{1}{(c+1)\ln(2)}=1$$ $$1=(c+1)\ln(2)$$ $$c=\dfrac{1}{\ln(2)}-1$$
            solving for c gives us the point on $f(x)$ where $f'(c)=1$
            \\given $c=\dfrac{1}{\ln(2)}-1$, then we can graph the tangent line with the point slope form.\\ $y-f(c)=f'(c)(x-c)$, or
            $$y=f(c)+f'(c)(x-c)$$ or $$y=f(c)-c+x$$ since $f'(c)=1$. since $f(c)-c$ is constant, it would be a straight line, modeled by the green line in the following
            the green line shows the tangent line with least error throughout. In order to find the overall average error, we can divide the sum of y intercepts by two in order to get the value of $\mu$, modeled by the blue line.

                \begin{axis}[xlabel={$x$},ylabel={$f(x)$},xmin=0, xmax=1,ymin=0,ymax=1,samples=1000,grid=major]

                    \addplot[color=blue]{x-((1/ln(2)-1)-log10(1/ln(2))/log10(2))/2}
                \end{axis}
            \end{tikzpicture}
            red is $\log_2(x+1)$\\
            green is $x+c-f(c)$, where $f(c)=\log_2(x+1)$\\
            blue is $x+\mu$, where $\mu=\dfrac{f(c)-c}{2}$

        \subsubsection{Newton's iteration}
            Newton's iteration is a way to approximate the root of a function, given $\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ at $f(x)$. The formula for newton's iteration is $$c=\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}$$

        \subsubsection{Mean Value Theorem} % (fold)
        \label{ssub:Mean Value Theorem}
            Mean Value Theorem, or MVT, states that if f(x) is continuous and differentiable within the range $a\le x \le b$, then there exists a point $c$ where $f'(c) = \dfrac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$

        \subsubsection{bitwise operators to stop forgetting}
            \begin{center}
                \& is and\\$|$ is or\\$\wedge$ is xor\\$\sim$ for not\\$>>$ or $<<$ for moving bits left and right respectively
            \end{center}
            \paragraph{bitwise operator quirks?}
                In C++, every number is represented in binary, or base 2. Thus if anyone were to divide a number by two, then
                \begin{verbatim}
                    x=x>>1;//shifting towards the right
                \end{verbatim}
                works the same, but is faster. it also rounds up. Conversely, if anyone were to multiply by two, then 
                \begin{verbatim}
                    x=x<<1;//shifting towards the left
                \end{verbatim}
                does the same.
        \subsubsection{IEEE 754}
            \paragraph{overview}
                This is how floats in C++ are stored. Floats are stored in 32 bit. the first bit is sign.
                The second to ninth bit is exponent, and the 10th to 32th bit is the mantissa. the exponent has
                an offset of 127, because it needs negative exponents. The mantissa, 23 bits, is the representation of the number(scientific notation).
                The equation to get from float to the final number is given by:
                \begin{equation}
                    (1+\dfrac{M}{2^{23}})\cdot2^{E-127}
                \end{equation}
            \paragraph{nitty griddy}
                The layout of this(the float) is 
                \begin{center}
                    sign bit:1 bit\\
                    exponent:1 byte(8 bits)\\
                    mantissa:23 bits\\
                \end{center}
                So if we were to follow this and try to extract exponents, we can do
                \begin{verbatim}
                    o = ((0xff<<23)&i)-127;
                \end{verbatim}
                and extracting the mantissa would be just 
                \begin{verbatim}
                    o = ((~(0xff<<23))&i);
                \end{verbatim}
                assuming the variables i and o are unsigned longs.
    \subsection{optimizations}
        \subsubsection{division}
            Since so much work has been done on addition subtraction and multiplication, the only real operation that needs change is division
            here, we will focus mostly on floats. A really easy way is to just \begin{verbatim}
                x=x/y;
            \end{verbatim}
            but in order to optimize this, we will use

            \paragraph{rules}
                there are three rules for work to exist.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item force must be applied
                    \item there must be a displacement
                    \item there must be a direction
                \end{itemize}
            \paragraph{equations}
